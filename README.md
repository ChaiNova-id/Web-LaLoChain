# 🏨 LaLoChain

LaLoChain is a decentralized real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform focused on **landlord-tenancy** revenue, particularly for properties like hotels and rentals. It enables property owners to tokenize their **future revenue streams**, allowing investors to buy in and earn passive income, while leveraging AVS (Actively Validated Services) and underwriters for reliability and guarantees.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🏘️ Tokenize real estate revenue (e.g. $60K/year hotel revenue)
- 💰 Raise upfront capital (e.g. $50K) by selling future revenue as tokens
- 🔐 Underwriter-backed guarantees for:
  - Full repayment (monthly: e.g. $5K/month for 12 months)
  - Token sellout before revenue return cycle begins
- ⚙️ Integrated with AVS to actively validate on-chain & off-chain commitments
- 🔁 Optional restaking reward sharing with underwriters/validators
- 📈 Secondary trading support (ERC-20 or NFT standardized revenue tokens)

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS + Wagmi + RainbowKit
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (Deployed on EVM-compatible chain)
- **AVS Integration**: EigenLayer / Custom validator AVS
- **Underwriting Engine**: Custom module using smart contracts + escrow
- **Storage/Proof**: IPFS/zkProof (for document-backed tokenization)
